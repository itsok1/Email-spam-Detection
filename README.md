# Spam-Detection
This is an email spam filter using a dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset/data

**What Are Naive Bayes?**

Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem. The theorem combines prior probability, likelihood, and marginal probability to calculate the posterior probability. here are different types of Naive Bayes classifiers, including Gaussian for continuous data, Multinomial for discrete data like word counts, and Bernoulli for binary features.

**Project Overview**

The classifier will be developed using a dataset of approximately 5,000 English SMS messages labeled as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam."

To create this spam detector, I applied the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for tokenizing text and extract features from the text data using CountVectorizer and delve into the theoretical underpinnings of Naive Bayes classifiers, including concepts such as likelihood, prior probability, and marginal likelihood. Finally, a Naive Bayes classifier model was trained using the Scikit-learn library and Python functions to seamlessly integrate our model with a Pandas DataFrame for practical applications.

**Motives of the project**

As a student pursuing Mathematics and Computer Science, I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. Recently, I took a probability course in school and became fascinated by Bayes' Theorem. I saw an exciting opportunity to integrate it into a coding project that combines my academic interests in probability, machine learning, and real-world problem-solving. Recognizing that mathematics often feels abstract, I was motivated to transform theoretical knowledge into actionable insights by applying it to a tangible, everyday challenge. Given the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and the impactful role of natural language processing (NLP), I focused on creating an email spam detector. By working on this project, I enhanced my understanding of machine learning pipelines, probability-based decision-making, and NLP techniques, all while honing my software development skills. This experience has fueled my desire to continue solving practical problems at the intersection of mathematics, AI, and technology.
